# Hotel_reviews_1

In this project we will be following a process of data discovery, data 
preparation, and model building to predict whether or not a hotel review is positive or 
negative.
At the end of it, we will see how this forecasting task is satisfied with the Machine 
Learning techniques that I use, achieving accuracy in the predictions superior to 
90%.

You can find a report about the whole process called ReportIndividualAssignment1vF.
